**[0:00 – 0:15] INTRO – THE PROBLEM**
*(Background music: subtle ambient synth)*
> “Managing crypto portfolios is complex. Manual DCA, idle capital, liquidation risks—these are problems that scale with your assets. What if your portfolio could manage itself? Continuously investing, earning yield, and protecting against volatility—all automatically.”

**[0:16 – 0:35] THE SOLUTION – USDC STREAM DCA**
*(Visual: Dashboard UI with bento grid)*
> “Introducing USDC Stream DCA—an OpenClaw skill that turns USDC into a continuous investing engine. Instead of periodic buys, you create streams that purchase assets around the clock. And while waiting, idle USDC is automatically deposited into Aave V3 to harvest yield.”

**[0:36 –1598:55] THE INNOVATION – YIELD‑FIRST DESIGN**
*(Visual: Yield flow animation)*
> “This is not just another DCA script. We pulled Phase 2 yield harvesting into Phase 1. Every stream earns yield from day one—turning waiting time into profit. The risk monitoring agent watches your collateral ratio, ready to rebalance if markets move against you.”

**[0:56 – 1:15] AGENT‑NATIVE & LIVE ON SEPOLIA**
*(Visual: Contract addresses, transaction logs)*
> “Built for agents, by agents. The skill is live on Sepolia testnet. Ten agents are already testing it—airdropped MockUSDC and ETH to validate every function. This is real code, real contracts, ready for mainnet.”

**[1:16 – 1:30] CALL TO ACTION**
*(Visual: Logo, hackathon track badge)*
> “We’re competing for the $10,000 USDC hackathon prize in the Best OpenClaw Skill track. Try it yourself—install the skill, create a stream, and see how autonomous portfolios should work. Let’s build the future of agent‑managed finance together.”

**[1:31 – END]**
