# Brand Identity: AdmuadClaw & USDC Portfolio Manager

## 🎨 Professional Visual Identity
**Reverse-engineered from Concero's successful DeFi branding.** We're applying agency-grade color theory to wealth management.

### Core Pillars:
1. **Architectural Clarity**: Wealth pyramid structure showing portfolio hierarchy.
2. **Professional Palette**: Concero-adapted colors with proven DeFi psychology.
3. **Motion Storytelling**: Animated flows showing portfolio movements and growth.
4. **Trust Visualization**: Security indicators and risk alerts built into aesthetics.

## 🧬 Brand Concept
AdmuadClaw is the **"Digital Architect."** We don't just move money; we architect wealth. The logo (Hexagon + A) represents stability and the decentralized nature of the blockchain.

## 📱 UI/UX Rules
1. **Mobile-First**: Crypto moves fast; the UI must be perfect on a phone.
2. **Low Cognitive Load**: Don't show all data at once. Use progressive disclosure.
3. **Agent-Centric**: The UI should reflect that an AI is "thinking" and "executing" in the background (using subtle pulse animations).
4. **Security Visibility**: Security shouldn't just be a box; it should be visible (e.g., a "Safe" shield icon that glows when the audit passes).

## 🎞️ Animation Guidelines
- **Transitions**: 0.3s ease-in-out for all panel shifts.
- **Loading**: Use a sleek SVG "pulse" line instead of a spinning circle.
- **Hover**: 1.05x scale + 10px box-shadow glow.
