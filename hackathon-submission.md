## 🏆 Track 2: Best OpenClaw Skill

### Project: Autonomous Evolution Core

**Revolutionary AI Agent Skill That Turns Tools Into Autonomous Partners**

---

## 🎯 The Problem
AI agents today are **fragile tools** that say "I can't do that" when they encounter problems. They need constant hand-holding and can't fix themselves.

## ✨ The Solution
**Autonomous Evolution Core** - A skill that makes ANY AI agent:
- 🦾 **Self-Diagnosing** - Detects tool failures automatically
- 🔧 **Self-Repairing** - Installs missing packages & fixes configs
- 📚 **Self-Learning** - Learns from successes/failures over time
- ⏰ **24/7 Autonomous** - Runs background checks & proactive maintenance
- 🚀 **Self-Optimizing** - Continuously improves its own performance

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Self-Diagnosis Engine**
```bash
evolution diagnose web_search
```
Detects missing API keys, broken tools, permission issues.

### 2. **Real Auto-Fixes**
```bash
evolution autofix web_search
```
Actually installs packages (`npm install brave-search-api`) and updates OpenClaw configuration.

### 3. **Evolution Engine**
```bash
evolution enable
```
Enables 24/7 monitoring, learning loops, and autonomous operation.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Install from ClawHub (once published)
clawhub install autonomous-evolution-core

# Or install manually
cd ~/.openclaw/skills
git clone https://github.com/Admuad/autonomous-evolution-core
cd autonomous-evolution-core
npm install
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

```bash
# Enable autonomous evolution
evolution enable

# Check agent health status
evolution status

# Diagnose specific tool
evolution diagnose web_search

# Auto-diagnose and fix tool
evolution autofix web_search

# Enable 24/7 monitoring
evolution monitor --enable
```
